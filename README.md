Tic Tac Toe Game

This repository contains a Tic Tac Toe game project implemented in React. The game allows two players (Player 1 and Player 2) to compete against each other on a 3x3 board, alternating between "X" and "O". The project demonstrates the use of React Hooks, state management, and component navigation using react-router-dom.


Features:
- Interactive Interface: Simple and intuitive user interface that allows players to enter their names and choose the win condition (3 or 5 wins).
- Dynamic Gameplay: The game includes a hover logic that temporarily shows where the "X" or "O" will be placed, helping players visualize their moves before confirming them.
- Efficient Navigation: Utilizes React Router's useNavigate to transition between the start screen, the game board, and later to a ranking screen upon reaching the win condition.
- Responsive Design: Modular CSS to keep the game visually appealing and functional across different devices.


Technologies Used:
- React (including Hooks like useState and useEffect)
- React Router for route management
- CSS for styling

  
How to Play:
- Clone the repository.
- Install the dependencies using npm install.
